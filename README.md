# shave-template

Content injection is accomplished using standard HTML tag names and CSS selectors.

This module allows you to develop plain HTML/CSS templates with dummy data in the places dynamic
data will be inserted. The benefit is that the templates can be developed independently from the
programming that dynamically inserts data into the web page.
